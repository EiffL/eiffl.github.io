**I am a CNRS researcher working at the intersection between Deep Learning, Statistical Modeling, and Observational Cosmology**. I am particularly interested in combining tools and methodologies from the field of Machine Learning (automatic differentiation, deep generative models, score-based high-dimensional inference) with physical modeling for the analysis of Stage IV Cosmological Surveys.

I am currently co-Chair of the [LSST Informatics & Statistics Science Collaboration](https://issc.science.lsst.org) (LSST ISSC) and actively involved in the [LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org/) (LSST DESC).

<p>Before my CNRS position, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the <a class="reference external" href="http://bccp.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Center for Cosmological
Physics</a> (BCCP) and with the <a class="reference external" href="https://foda.berkeley.edu/">Foundation of Data Analysis</a> (FODA)
institute at UC Berkeley, working with Prof. <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/uros-seljak">Uro≈° Seljak</a>. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the
McWilliams Center for Cosmology at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was working with
Prof. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rmandelb/">Rachel Mandelbaum</a> on weak
gravitational lensing measurements and systematics, and interacted with both
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/">Statistics</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning</a> departments while at CMU.</p>
