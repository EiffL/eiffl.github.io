 abstract = {{Context. The number density of galaxy clusters across mass and redshift
has been established as a powerful cosmological probe, yielding
important information on the matter components of the Universe.
Cosmological analyses with galaxy clusters traditionally employ
scaling relations, which are empirical relationships between
cluster masses and their observable properties. However, many
challenges arise from this approach as the scaling relations are
highly scattered, maybe ill-calibrated, depend on the cosmology,
and contain many nuisance parameters with low physical
significance. Aims. For this paper, we used a simulation-based
inference method utilizing artificial neural networks to
optimally extract cosmological information from a shallow X-ray
survey, solely using count rates, hardness ratios, and
redshifts. This procedure enabled us to conduct likelihood-free
inference of cosmological parameters {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$
and {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$. Methods. To achieve this, we
analytically generated several datasets of 70 000 cluster
samples with totally random combinations of cosmological and
scaling relation parameters. Each sample in our simulation is
represented by its galaxy cluster distribution in a count rate
(CR) and hardness ratio (HR) space in multiple redshift bins. We
trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to retrieve the
cosmological parameters from these distributions. We then used
neural density estimation (NDE) neural networks to predict the
posterior probability distribution of
{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ and {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$
given an input galaxy cluster sample. Results. Using the survey
area as a proxy for the number of clusters detected for fixed
cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and hence of the
Poissonian noise, we analyze various survey sizes. The
1{\ensuremath{\sigma}} errors of our density estimator on one of
the target testing simulations are 1000 deg$^{2}$, 15.2\% for
{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ and 10.0\% for
{\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$; and 10 000 deg$^{2}$, 9.6\% for
{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ and 5.6\% for
{\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$. We also compare our results with a
traditional Fisher analysis and explore the effect of an
additional constraint on the redshift distribution of the
simulated samples. Conclusions. We demonstrate, as a proof of
concept, that it is possible to calculate cosmological
predictions of {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ and
{\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ from a galaxy cluster population
without explicitly computing cluster masses and even the scaling
relation coefficients, thus avoiding potential biases resulting
from such a procedure.}},

gravitational lensing analyses if they are not properly modeled.
Due to computational constraints, simulating the intricate
details of galaxy formation and evolution relevant to IA across
vast volumes is impractical. As an alternative, we propose a
Deep Generative Model trained on the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation

$\mathbb{R}^n$ diffusion generative model, for galaxy
orientations and $n$ scalars, implemented with E(3) equivariant
Graph Neural Networks that explicitly respect the Euclidean
symmetries of our Universe. The model is able to learn and
predict features such as galaxy orientations that are
statistically consistent with the reference simulation. Notably,
our model demonstrates the ability to jointly model Euclidean-

our ability to constrain with precision cosmological parameters.
Thus, recent years have seen a paradigm shift from analytical
likelihood-based to simulation-based inference. However, such
methods require a large number of costly simulations. We focus
on full-field inference, considered the optimal form of
inference. Our objective is to benchmark several ways of
conducting full-field inference to gain insight into the number
of simulations required for each method. We make a distinction
between explicit and implicit full-field inference. Moreover, as
it is crucial for explicit full-field inference to use a
differentiable forward model, we aim to discuss the advantages
of having this property for the implicit approach. We use the
sbi\_lens package which provides a fast and differentiable log-
normal forward model. This forward model enables us to compare
explicit and implicit full-field inference with and without
gradient. The former is achieved by sampling the forward model
through the No U-Turns sampler. The latter starts by compressing
the data into sufficient statistics and uses the Neural
Likelihood Estimation algorithm and the one augmented with
gradient. We perform a full-field analysis on LSST Y10 like weak
lensing simulated mass maps. We show that explicit and implicit
full-field inference yield consistent constraints. Explicit
inference requires 630 000 simulations with our particular
sampler corresponding to 400 independent samples. Implicit
inference requires a maximum of 101 000 simulations split into
100 000 simulations to build sufficient statistics (this number
is not fine tuned) and 1 000 simulations to perform inference.
Additionally, we show that our way of exploiting the gradients

Differentiable Lensing Lightcone (DLL) model, designed for use
as a forward model in Bayesian inference algorithms that require
access to derivatives of lensing observables with respect to
cosmological parameters. \textbackslash Methods: We extended the
public FlowPM N-body code, a particle-mesh N-body solver, while
simulating the lensing lightcones and implementing the Born
approximation in the Tensorflow framework. Furthermore, DLL is
aimed at achieving high accuracy with low computational costs.
As such, it integrates a novel hybrid physical-neural (HPN)
parameterization that is able to compensate for the small-scale
approximations resulting from particle-mesh schemes for
cosmological N-body simulations. We validated our simulations in
the context of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) against high-resolution
{\ensuremath{\kappa}}TNG-Dark simulations by comparing both the
lensing angular power spectrum and multiscale peak counts. We
demonstrated its ability to recover lensing
C$_{{\ensuremath{\ell}}}$ up to a 10\% accuracy at
{\ensuremath{\ell}} = 1000 for sources at a redshift of 1, with
as few as {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.6 particles per Mpc
h$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$. As a first-use case, we applied this
tool to an investigation of the relative constraining power of
the angular power spectrum and peak counts statistic in an LSST
setting. Such comparisons are typically very costly as they
require a large number of simulations and do not scale
appropriately with an increasing number of cosmological
parameters. As opposed to forecasts based on finite differences,
these statistics can be analytically differentiated with respect
to cosmology or any systematics included in the simulations at
the same computational cost of the forward simulation.
\textbackslash Results: We find that the peak counts outperform
the power spectrum in terms of the cold dark matter parameter,
{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{c}$, as well as on the amplitude of
density fluctuations, {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$, and the
amplitude of the intrinsic alignment signal, A$_{IA}$.}},

features, are a valuable tool in the detection of past or
ongoing galaxy mergers, and their properties can answer
questions about the progenitor galaxies involved in the
interactions. The assembly of current tidal feature samples is
primarily achieved using visual classification, making it
difficult to construct large samples and draw accurate and
statistically robust conclusions about the galaxy evolution
process. With upcoming large optical imaging surveys such as the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time
(LSST), predicted to observe billions of galaxies, it is
imperative that we refine our methods of detecting and
classifying samples of merging galaxies. This paper presents
promising results from a self-supervised machine learning model,
trained on data from the Ultradeep layer of the Hyper Suprime-
Cam Subaru Strategic Program optical imaging survey, designed to
automate the detection of tidal features. We find that self-
supervised models are capable of detecting tidal features, and
that our model outperforms previous automated tidal feature
detection methods, including a fully supervised model. An
earlier method applied to real galaxy images achieved 76\%
completeness for 22\% contamination, while our model achieves
considerably higher (96\%) completeness for the same level of
contamination. We emphasise a number of advantages of self-
supervised models over fully supervised models including
maintaining excellent performance when using only 50 labelled
examples for training, and the ability to perform similarity
searches using a single example of a galaxy with tidal features.}},

has created a new coding ecosystem, especially in probabilistic
programming. As well as batch acceleration, just-in-time

hardware modalities (CPU, GPU, TPU), JAX exposes an automatic
differentiation (autodiff) mechanism. Thanks to autodiff, jax-
cosmo gives access to the derivatives of cosmological

enables a range of powerful Bayesian inference algorithms,
otherwise impractical in cosmology, such as Hamiltonian Monte

cosmo implements background evolution, linear and non-linear
power spectra (using halofit or the Eisenstein and Hu transfer

approximation for galaxy and weak lensing probes, all
differentiable with respect to the cosmological parameters and
their other inputs. We illustrate how autodiff can be a game-
changer for common tasks involving Fisher matrix computations,

 abstract = {{Context. Weak lensing mass-mapping is a useful tool for accessing the
full distribution of dark matter on the sky, but because of
intrinsic galaxy ellipticies, finite fields, and missing data,
the recovery of dark matter maps constitutes a challenging, ill-
posed inverse problem \textbackslash Aims: We introduce a novel
methodology that enables the efficient sampling of the high-
dimensional Bayesian posterior of the weak lensing mass-mapping
problem, relying on simulations to define a fully non-Gaussian
prior. We aim to demonstrate the accuracy of the method to
simulated fields, and then proceed to apply it to the mass
reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field. \textbackslash
Methods: The proposed methodology combines elements of Bayesian
statistics, analytic theory, and a recent class of deep
generative models based on neural score matching. This approach
allows us to make full use of analytic cosmological theory to
constrain the 2pt statistics of the solution, to understand any
differences between this analytic prior and full simulations
from cosmological simulations, and to obtain samples from the
full Bayesian posterior of the problem for robust uncertainty
quantification. \textbackslash Results: We demonstrate the
method in the {\ensuremath{\kappa}}TNG simulations and find that
the posterior mean significantly outperfoms previous methods
(Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, Sparsity priors) both for the
root-mean-square error and in terms of the Pearson correlation.
We further illustrate the interpretability of the recovered
posterior by establishing a close correlation between posterior
convergence values and the S/N of the clusters artificially
introduced into a field. Finally, we apply the method to the
reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field, which yields the
highest-quality convergence map of this field to date.
\textbackslash Conclusions: We find the proposed approach to be
superior to previous algorithms, scalable, providing
uncertainties, and using a fully non-Gaussian prior.

will soon provide imaging and spectra of hundreds of millions of
galaxies. Extracting coherent scientific information from these
large and multi-modal data sets remains an open issue for the
community and data-driven approaches such as deep learning have
rapidly emerged as a potentially powerful solution to some long
lasting challenges. This enthusiasm is reflected in an
unprecedented exponential growth of publications using neural
networks, which have gone from a handful of works in 2015 to an
average of one paper per week in 2021 in the area of galaxy
surveys. Half a decade after the first published work in
astronomy mentioning deep learning, and shortly before new big
data sets such as Euclid and LSST start becoming available, we
believe it is timely to review what has been the real impact of
this new technology in the field and its potential to solve key
challenges raised by the size and complexity of the new
datasets. The purpose of this review is thus two-fold. We first
aim at summarising, in a common document, the main applications
of deep learning for galaxy surveys that have emerged so far. We
then extract the major achievements and lessons learned and
highlight key open questions and limitations, which in our
opinion, will require particular attention in the coming years.
Overall, state-of-the-art deep learning methods are rapidly
adopted by the astronomical community, reflecting a
democratisation of these methods. This review shows that the
majority of works using deep learning up to date are oriented to
computer vision tasks (e.g. classification, segmentation). This
is also the domain of application where deep learning has
brought the most important breakthroughs so far. However, we
also report that the applications are becoming more diverse and
deep learning is used for estimating galaxy properties,
identifying outliers or constraining the cosmological model.
Most of these works remain at the exploratory level though which
could partially explain the limited impact in terms of
citations. Some common challenges will most likely need to be
addressed before moving to the next phase of massive deployment
of deep learning in the processing of future surveys; for
example, uncertainty quantification, interpretability, data
labelling and domain shift issues from training with
simulations, which constitutes a common practice in astronomy.}},

 abstract = {{As the volume and quality of modern galaxy surveys increase, so does the
difficulty of measuring the cosmological signal imprinted in
galaxy shapes. Weak gravitational lensing sourced by the most
massive structures in the Universe generates a slight shearing
of galaxy morphologies called cosmic shear, key probe for
cosmological models. Modern techniques of shear estimation based
on statistics of ellipticity measurements suffer from the fact
that the ellipticity is not a well-defined quantity for
arbitrary galaxy light profiles, biasing the shear estimation.
We show that a hybrid physical and deep learning Hierarchical
Bayesian Model, where a generative model captures the galaxy
morphology, enables us to recover an unbiased estimate of the
shear on realistic galaxies, thus solving the model bias.}},

 abstract = {{In order to prepare for the upcoming wide-field cosmological surveys,
large simulations of the Universe with realistic galaxy
populations are required. In particular, the tendency of
galaxies to naturally align towards overdensities, an effect
called intrinsic alignments (IA), can be a major source of
systematics in the weak lensing analysis. As the details of
galaxy formation and evolution relevant to IA cannot be
simulated in practice on such volumes, we propose as an
alternative a Deep Generative Model. This model is trained on
the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation and is capable of sampling the
orientations of a population of galaxies so as to recover the
correct alignments. In our approach, we model the cosmic web as
a set of graphs, where the graphs are constructed for each halo,
and galaxy orientations as a signal on those graphs. The
generative model is implemented on a Generative Adversarial
Network architecture and uses specifically designed Graph-
Convolutional Networks sensitive to the relative 3D positions of
the vertices. Given (sub)halo masses and tidal fields, the model
is able to learn and predict scalar features such as galaxy and
dark matter subhalo shapes; and more importantly, vector
features such as the 3D orientation of the major axis of the
ellipsoid and the complex 2D ellipticities. For correlations of
3D orientations the model is in good quantitative agreement with
the measured values from the simulation, except for at very
small and transition scales. For correlations of 2D
ellipticities, the model is in good quantitative agreement with
the measured values from the simulation on all scales.
Additionally, the model is able to capture the dependence of IA
on mass, morphological type, and central/satellite type.}},

 abstract = {{The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
dataset will dramatically alter our understanding of the
Universe, from the origins of the Solar System to the nature of
dark matter and dark energy. Much of this research will depend
on the existence of robust, tested, and scalable algorithms,
software, and services. Identifying and developing such tools
ahead of time has the potential to significantly accelerate the
delivery of early science from LSST. Developing these
collaboratively, and making them broadly available, can enable
more inclusive and equitable collaboration on LSST science. To
facilitate such opportunities, a community workshop entitled
``From Data to Software to Science with the Rubin Observatory
LSST'' was organized by the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for
Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) and partners, and held at
the Flatiron Institute in New York, March 28-30th 2022. The
workshop included over 50 in-person attendees invited from over
300 applications. It identified seven key software areas of
need: (i) scalable cross-matching and distributed joining of
catalogs, (ii) robust photometric redshift determination, (iii)
software for determination of selection functions, (iv)
frameworks for scalable time-series analyses, (v) services for
image access and reprocessing at scale, (vi) object image access
(cutouts) and analysis at scale, and (vii) scalable job
execution systems. This white paper summarizes the discussions
of this workshop. It considers the motivating science use cases,
identified cross-cutting algorithms, software, and services,
their high-level technical specifications, and the principles of
inclusive collaborations needed to develop them. We provide it
as a useful roadmap of needs, as well as to spur action and
collaboration between groups and individuals looking to develop
reusable software for early LSST science.}},

preservation of physical information (e.g., flux and shape) of

reduces the pixel error. In this paper, we extend the Tikhonet
approach to take this shape constraint into account and apply
our new DL method, called ShapeNet, to a simulated optical and

relies on i) the shape constraint we use in the neural network

image deconvolution for the first time, and iii) the generation

 abstract = {{The problem of anomaly detection in astronomical surveys is becoming
increasingly important as data sets grow in size. We present the
results of an unsupervised anomaly detection method using a
Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) on nearly one
million optical galaxy images in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC)
survey. The WGAN learns to generate realistic HSC-like galaxies
that follow the distribution of the data set; anomalous images
are defined based on a poor reconstruction by the generator and
outlying features learned by the discriminator. We find that the
discriminator is more attuned to potentially interesting
anomalies compared to the generator, and compared to a simpler
autoencoder-based anomaly detection approach, so we use the
discriminator-selected images to construct a high-anomaly sample
of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde13 000 objects. We propose a
new approach to further characterize these anomalous images: we
use a convolutional autoencoder to reduce the dimensionality of
the residual differences between the real and WGAN-reconstructed
images and perform UMAP clustering on these. We report detected
anomalies of interest including galaxy mergers, tidal features,
and extreme star-forming galaxies. A follow-up spectroscopic
analysis of one of these anomalies is detailed in the Appendix;
we find that it is an unusual system most likely to be a metal-
poor dwarf galaxy with an extremely blue, higher-metallicity H
II region. We have released a catalogue with the WGAN anomaly
scores; the code and catalogue are available at
https://github.com/kstoreyf/anomalies-GAN-HSC; and our
interactive visualization tool for exploring the clustered data
is at https://weirdgalaxi.es.}},

 abstract = {{This paper presents the results of the Rubin Observatory Dark Energy
Science Collaboration (DESC) 3x2pt tomography challenge, which
served as a first step toward optimizing the tomographic binning
strategy for the main DESC analysis. The task of choosing an
optimal tomographic binning scheme for a photometric survey is
made particularly delicate in the context of a metacalibrated
lensing catalogue, as only the photometry from the bands
included in the metacalibration process (usually riz and
potentially g) can be used in sample definition. The goal of the
challenge was to collect and compare bin assignment strategies
under various metrics of a standard 3x2pt cosmology analysis in
a highly idealized setting to establish a baseline for
realistically complex follow-up studies; in this preliminary
study, we used two sets of cosmological simulations of galaxy
redshifts and photometry under a simple noise model neglecting
photometric outliers and variation in observing conditions, and
contributed algorithms were provided with a representative and
complete training set. We review and evaluate the entries to the
challenge, finding that even from this limited photometry
information, multiple algorithms can separate tomographic bins
reasonably well, reaching figures-of-merit scores close to the
attainable maximum. We further find that adding the g band to
riz photometry improves metric performance by
\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde15\% and that the optimal bin
assignment strategy depends strongly on the science case: which
figure-of-merit is to be optimized, and which observables

 abstract = {{Recent deep-learning models have achieved impressive prediction
performance, but often sacrifice interpretability and
computational efficiency. Interpretability is crucial in many
disciplines, such as science and medicine, where models must be
carefully vetted or where interpretation is the goal itself.
Moreover, interpretable models are concise and often yield
computational efficiency. Here, we propose adaptive wavelet
distillation (AWD), a method which aims to distill information
from a trained neural network into a wavelet transform.
Specifically, AWD penalizes feature attributions of a neural
network in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-
resolution wavelet transform. The resulting model is highly
predictive, concise, computationally efficient, and has
properties (such as a multi-scale structure) which make it easy
to interpret. In close collaboration with domain experts, we
showcase how AWD addresses challenges in two real-world
settings: cosmological parameter inference and molecular-partner
prediction. In both cases, AWD yields a scientifically
interpretable and concise model which gives predictive
performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks.
Moreover, AWD identifies predictive features that are
scientifically meaningful in the context of respective domains.

 abstract = {{Image simulations are essential tools for preparing and validating the
analysis of current and future wide-field optical surveys.
However, the galaxy models used as the basis for these
simulations are typically limited to simple parametric light
profiles, or use a fairly limited amount of available space-
based data. In this work, we propose a methodology based on deep
generative models to create complex models of galaxy
morphologies that may meet the image simulation needs of
upcoming surveys. We address the technical challenges associated
with learning this morphology model from noisy and point spread
function (PSF)-convolved images by building a hybrid Deep
Learning/physical Bayesian hierarchical model for observed
images, explicitly accounting for the PSF and noise properties.
The generative model is further made conditional on physical
galaxy parameters, to allow for sampling new light profiles from
specific galaxy populations. We demonstrate our ability to train
and sample from such a model on galaxy postage stamps from the
HST/ACS COSMOS survey, and validate the quality of the model
using a range of second- and higher order morphology statistics.
Using this set of statistics, we demonstrate significantly more
realistic morphologies using these deep generative models
compared to conventional parametric models. To help make these
generative models practical tools for the community, we
introduce GALSIM-HUB, a community-driven repository of
generative models, and a framework for incorporating generative
models within the GALSIM image simulation software.}},

 abstract = {{Fast and automated inference of binary-lens, single-source (2L1S)
microlensing events with sampling-based Bayesian algorithms
(e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo, MCMC) is challenged on two
fronts: the high computational cost of likelihood evaluations
with microlensing simulation codes, and a pathological parameter
space where the negative-log-likelihood surface can contain a
multitude of local minima that are narrow and deep. Analysis of
2L1S events usually involves grid searches over some parameters
to locate approximate solutions as a prerequisite to posterior
sampling, an expensive process that often requires human-in-the-
loop domain expertise. As the next-generation, space-based
microlensing survey with the Roman Space Telescope is expected
to yield thousands of binary microlensing events, a new fast and
automated method is desirable. Here, we present a likelihood-
free inference approach named amortized neural posterior
estimation, where a neural density estimator (NDE) learns a
surrogate posterior $\hat{p}({\boldsymbol{\theta }}|
{\boldsymbol{x}})$ as an observation-parameterized conditional
probability distribution, from pre-computed simulations over the
full prior space. Trained on 291,012 simulated Roman-like 2L1S
simulations, the NDE produces accurate and precise posteriors
within seconds for any observation within the prior support
without requiring a domain expert in the loop, thus allowing for
real-time and automated inference. We show that the NDE also
captures expected posterior degeneracies. The NDE posterior
could then be refined into the exact posterior with a downstream
MCMC sampler with minimal burn-in steps.}},

 abstract = {{An astronomical survey's observing strategy, which encompasses the
frequency and duration of visits to each portion of the sky,
impacts the degree to which its data can answer the most
pressing questions about the universe. Surveys with diverse
scientific goals pose a special challenge for survey design
decisionmaking; even if each physical parameter of interest has
a corresponding quantitative metric, there's no guarantee of a
``one size fits all'' optimal observing strategy. While
traditional observing strategy metrics must be specific to the
science case in question, we exploit a chain rule of the
variational mutual information to engineer TheLastMetric, an
interpretable, extensible metric that enables coherent observing
strategy optimization over multiple science objectives. The
upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (LSST) serves as an ideal application for this metric, as
many of its extreagalactic science goals rely upon purely
photometric redshift constraints. As a demonstration, we use the
LSST Metrics Analysis Framework (MAF) to quantify how much
information about redshift is contained within photometry,
conditioned on a fiducial true galaxy catalog and mock
observations under each of several given observing strategies,
generated by the LSST Operations Simulator (OpSim). We compare
traditional metrics of photometric redshift performance to
TheLastMetric and interpret their differences from the
perspective of observing strategy optimization. Finally, we
illustrate how to extend TheLastMetric to cosmological
constraints by multiple probes, jointly or individually.}},

 abstract = {{While weak gravitational lensing is one of the most promising
cosmological probes targeted by upcoming wide-field surveys,
exploiting the full information content of the cosmic shear
signal remains a major challenge. One dimension of this
challenge is the fact that analytic cosmological models only
describe the 2pt functions of the lensing signal, while we know
the convergence field to be significantly non-Gaussian. As a
result, solving a problem like weak lensing mass-mapping using
analytic Gaussian priors will be sub-optimal. We do however have
access to models that can capture the full statistics of the
lensing signal: numerical simulations. But the question is: how
can we use samples from numerical simulations to solve a
Bayesian inference problem such as weak lensing mass-mapping?
\textbackslash\textbackslashIn this talk, I will illustrate how
recent deep generative modeling provides us with the tools
needed to leverage a physical model in the form of numerical
simulations to perform proper Bayesian inference.
\textbackslash\textbackslashUsing Neural Score Estimation, we
learn from numerical simulations an estimate of the score
function (i.e. the gradient of the log density function) of the
distribution of convergence maps. We then use the learned score
function as a prior within an Annealed Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo
sampling scheme which allows us to access the full posterior
distribution of a mass-mapping problem, in {}10$^{6}$
dimensions.}},

 abstract = {{\textbackslash Aims: We introduce a novel approach to reconstructing
dark matter mass maps from weak gravitational lensing
measurements. The cornerstone of the proposed method lies in a
new modelling of the matter density field in the Universe as a
mixture of two components: (1) a sparsity-based component that
captures the non-Gaussian structure of the field, such as peaks
or halos at different spatial scales, and (2) a Gaussian random
field, which is known to represent the linear characteristics of
the field well. \textbackslash Methods: We propose an algorithm
called MCALens that jointly estimates these two components.
MCALens is based on an alternating minimisation incorporating
both sparse recovery and a proximal iterative Wiener filtering.
\textbackslash Results: Experimental results on simulated data
show that the proposed method exhibits improved estimation
accuracy compared to customised mass-map reconstruction methods.}},

 abstract = {{The observing strategy of a galaxy survey influences the degree to which
its resulting data can be used to accomplish any science goal.
LSST is thus seeking metrics of observing strategies for
multiple science cases in order to optimally choose a cadence.
Photometric redshifts are essential for many extragalactic
science applications of LSST's data, including but not limited
to cosmology, but there are few metrics available, and they are
not straightforwardly integrated with metrics of other cadence-
dependent quantities that may influence any given use case. We
propose a metric for observing strategy optimization based on
the potentially recoverable mutual information about redshift
from a photometric sample under the constraints of a realistic
observing strategy. We demonstrate a tractable estimation of a
variational lower bound of this mutual information implemented
in a public code using conditional normalizing flows. By
comparing the recoverable redshift information across observing
strategies, we can distinguish between those that preclude
robust redshift constraints and those whose data will preserve
more redshift information, to be generically utilized in a
downstream analysis. We recommend the use of this versatile
metric to observing strategy optimization for redshift-dependent
extragalactic use cases, including but not limited to cosmology,
as well as any other science applications for which photometry

 abstract = {{Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution attempt to
fully model the physics that shapes galaxies. The agreement
between the morphology of simulated and real galaxies, and the
way the morphological types are distributed across galaxy
scaling relations are important probes of our knowledge of
galaxy formation physics. Here, we propose an unsupervised deep
learning approach to perform a stringent test of the fine
morphological structure of galaxies coming from the Illustris
and IllustrisTNG (TNG100 and TNG50) simulations against
observations from a subsample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
Our framework is based on PixelCNN, an autoregressive model for
image generation with an explicit likelihood. We adopt a
strategy that combines the output of two PixelCNN networks in a
metric that isolates the small-scale morphological details of
galaxies from the sky background. We are able to quantitatively
identify the improvements of IllustrisTNG, particularly in the
high-resolution TNG50 run, over the original Illustris. However,
we find that the fine details of galaxy structure are still
different between observed and simulated galaxies. This
difference is mostly driven by small, more spheroidal, and
quenched galaxies that are globally less accurate regardless of
resolution and which have experienced little improvement between
the three simulations explored. We speculate that this
disagreement, that is less severe for quenched discy galaxies,
may stem from a still too coarse numerical resolution, which
struggles to properly capture the inner, dense regions of
quenched spheroidal galaxies.}},

Significant connections across multiple science domains will be
a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling
effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has
not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-
to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation,
through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic
cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with
Rubin's LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we
generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the
Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The
simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-
fast-deep area of approximately 300 deg$^{2}$, as well as a deep
drilling field of approximately 1 deg$^{2}$. We simulate 5 yr of
the planned 10 yr survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple
purposes. First, the LSST DESC working groups can use the data
set to develop a range of DESC analysis pipelines to prepare for
the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic test
bed for the image processing software under development for LSST
by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide
a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic
effects. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of
new scientific ideas in both static and time domain cosmology.}},

 abstract = {{In recent times, neural networks have become a powerful tool for the
analysis of complex and abstract data models. However, their
introduction intrinsically increases our uncertainty about which
features of the analysis are model-related and which are due to
the neural network. This means that predictions by neural
networks have biases which cannot be trivially distinguished
from being due to the true nature of the creation and
observation of data or not. In order to attempt to address such
issues we discuss Bayesian neural networks: neural networks
where the uncertainty due to the network can be characterised.
In particular, we present the Bayesian statistical framework
which allows us to categorise uncertainty in terms of the
ingrained randomness of observing certain data and the
uncertainty from our lack of knowledge about how data can be
created and observed. In presenting such techniques we show how
errors in prediction by neural networks can be obtained in
principle, and provide the two favoured methods for
characterising these errors. We will also describe how both of
these methods have substantial pitfalls when put into practice,
highlighting the need for other statistical techniques to truly
be able to do inference when using neural networks.}},

 abstract = {{Machine learning lies at the heart of new possibilities for scientific
discovery, knowledge generation, and artificial intelligence.
Its potential benefits to these fields requires going beyond
predictive accuracy and focusing on interpretability. In
particular, many scientific problems require interpretations in
a domain-specific interpretable feature space (e.g. the
frequency domain) whereas attributions to the raw features (e.g.
the pixel space) may be unintelligible or even misleading. To
address this challenge, we propose TRIM (TRansformation
IMportance), a novel approach which attributes importances to
features in a transformed space and can be applied post-hoc to a
fully trained model. TRIM is motivated by a cosmological
parameter estimation problem using deep neural networks (DNNs)
on simulated data, but it is generally applicable across
domains/models and can be combined with any local interpretation
method. In our cosmology example, combining TRIM with contextual
decomposition shows promising results for identifying which
frequencies a DNN uses, helping cosmologists to understand and
validate that the model learns appropriate physical features

 abstract = {{Large-scale imaging surveys will increase the number of galaxy-scale
strong lensing candidates by maybe three orders of magnitudes
beyond the number known today. Finding these rare objects will
require picking them out of at least tens of millions of images,
and deriving scientific results from them will require
quantifying the efficiency and bias of any search method. To
achieve these objectives automated methods must be developed.
Because gravitational lenses are rare objects, reducing false
positives will be particularly important. We present a
description and results of an open gravitational lens finding
challenge. Participants were asked to classify 100 000 candidate
objects as to whether they were gravitational lenses or not with
the goal of developing better automated methods for finding
lenses in large data sets. A variety of methods were used
including visual inspection, arc and ring finders, support
vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN).
We find that many of the methods will be easily fast enough to
analyse the anticipated data flow. In test data, several methods
are able to identify upwards of half the lenses after applying
some thresholds on the lens characteristics such as lensed image
brightness, size or contrast with the lens galaxy without making
a single false-positive identification. This is significantly
better than direct inspection by humans was able to do. Having
multi-band, ground based data is found to be better for this
purpose than single-band space based data with lower noise and
higher resolution, suggesting that multi-colour data is crucial.
Multi-band space based data will be superior to ground based
data. The most difficult challenge for a lens finder is
differentiating between rare, irregular and ring-like face-on
galaxies and true gravitational lenses. The degree to which the
efficiency and biases of lens finders can be quantified largely
depends on the realism of the simulated data on which the
finders are trained.}},

excellent typical seeing of the HSC survey (0.58 arcsec in the i

using weak gravitational lensing measurements is now a standard
tool in cosmology. Due to its importance to the science results
of current and upcoming surveys, the quality of the convergence
reconstruction methods should be well understood. We compare
three methods: Kaiser-Squires (KS), Wiener filter, and GLIMPSE.
Kaiser-Squires is a direct inversion, not accounting for survey
masks or noise. The Wiener filter is well-motivated for Gaussian
density fields in a Bayesian framework. GLIMPSE uses sparsity,
aiming to reconstruct non-linearities in the density field. We
compare these methods with several tests using public Dark
Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data and realistic
DES simulations. The Wiener filter and GLIMPSE offer substantial
improvements over smoothed Kaiser-Squires with a range of
metrics. Both the Wiener filter and GLIMPSE convergence
reconstructions show a 12 per cent improvement in Pearson
correlation with the underlying truth from simulations. To
compare the mapping methods' abilities to find mass peaks, we
measure the difference between peak counts from simulated
{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM shear catalogues and catalogues with
no mass fluctuations (a standard data vector when inferring
cosmology from peak statistics); the maximum signal-to-noise of
these peak statistics is increased by a factor of 3.5 for the
Wiener filter and 9 for GLIMPSE. With simulations, we measure
the reconstruction of the harmonic phases; the phase residuals'
concentration is improved 17 per cent by GLIMPSE and 18 per cent
by the Wiener filter. The correlationbetween reconstructions
from data and foreground redMaPPer clusters is increased 18 per
cent by the Wiener filter and 32 per cent by GLIMPSE.}},

galaxy-scale strongly lensed systems, fast and reliable
automated lens finding methods will be essential in the era of
large surveys such as Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Euclid

challenge, we introduce CMU DeepLens, a new fully automated
galaxy-galaxy lens finding method based on deep learning. This
supervised machine learning approach does not require any tuning
after the training step which only requires realistic image
simulations of strongly lensed systems. We train and validate
our model on a set of 20 000 LSST-like mock observations
including a range of lensed systems of various sizes and signal-
to-noise ratios (S/N). We find on our simulated data set that
for a rejection rate of non-lenses of 99 per cent, a
completeness of 90 per cent can be achieved for lenses with
Einstein radii larger than 1.4 arcsec and S/N larger than 20 on
individual g-band LSST exposures. Finally, we emphasize the
importance of realistically complex simulations for training
such machine learning methods by demonstrating that the

rare and extreme cosmic events in which the bulk of the baryonic
matter becomes displaced from the dark matter halos of the
colliding subclusters. Since all mass bends light, weak
gravitational lensing is a primary tool to study the total mass
distribution in such systems. Combined with X-ray and optical
analyses, mass maps of cluster mergers reconstructed from weak-
lensing observations have been used to constrain the self-
interaction cross-section of dark matter. The dynamically
complex Abell 520 (A520) cluster is an exceptional case, even
among merging systems: multi-wavelength observations have
revealed a surprising high mass-to-light concentration of dark
mass, the interpretation of which is difficult under the
standard assumption of effectively collisionless dark matter. We
revisit A520 using a new sparsity-based mass-mapping algorithm
to independently assess the presence of the puzzling dark core.
We obtain high-resolution mass reconstructions from two separate
galaxy shape catalogs derived from Hubble Space Telescope
observations of the system. Our mass maps agree well overall
with the results of previous studies, but we find important
differences. In particular, although we are able to identify the
dark core at a certain level in both data sets, it is at much
lower significance than has been reported before using the same
data. As we cannot confirm the detection in our analysis, we do
not consider A520 as posing a significant challenge to the
collisionless dark matter scenario.}},

powerful probes to investigate the nature of dark energy. As
such, weak lensing is at the heart of the next generation of
cosmological surveys such as LSST, Euclid or WFIRST.One
particularly crititcal source of systematic errors in these
surveys comes from the shape measurement algorithms tasked with
estimating galaxy shapes. GREAT3, the last community challenge
to assess the quality of state-of-the-art shape measurement
algorithms has in particular demonstrated that all current
methods are biased to various degrees and, more importantly,
that these biases depend on the details of the galaxy
morphologies. These biases can be measured and calibrated by
generating mock observations where a known lensing signal has
been introduced and comparing the resulting measurements to the
ground-truth. Producing these mock observations however requires
input galaxy images of higher resolution and S/N than the
simulated survey, which typically implies acquiring extremely
expensive space-based observations.The goal of this work is to
train a deep generative model on already available Hubble Space
Telescope data which can then be used to sample new galaxy
images conditioned on parameters such as magnitude, size or
redshift and exhibiting complex morphologies. Such model can
allow us to inexpensively produce large set of realistic
realistic images for calibration purposes.We implement a
conditional generative model based on state-of-the-art deep
learning methods and fit it to deep galaxy images from the
COSMOS survey. The quality of the model is assessed by computing
an extensive set of galaxy morphology statistics on the
generated images. Beyond simple second moment statistics such as
size and ellipticity, we apply more complex statistics
specifically designed to be sensitive to disturbed galaxy
morphologies. We find excellent agreement between the
morphologies of real and model generated galaxies.Our results
suggest that such deep generative models represent a reliable
alternative to the acquisition of expensive high quality
observations for generating the calibration data needed by the
next generation of weak lensing surveys.}},

 abstract = {{Understanding the nature of dark energy, the mysterious force driving
the accelerated expansion of the Universe, is a major challenge
of modern cosmology. The next generation of cosmological
surveys, specifically designed to address this issue, rely on
accurate measurements of the apparent shapes of distant
galaxies. However, shape measurement methods suffer from various
unavoidable biases and therefore will rely on a precise
calibration to meet the accuracy requirements of the science
analysis. This calibration process remains an open challenge as
it requires large sets of high quality galaxy images. To this
end, we study the application of deep conditional generative
models in generating realistic galaxy images. In particular we
consider variations on conditional variational autoencoder and
introduce a new adversarial objective for training of
conditional generative networks. Our results suggest a reliable
alternative to the acquisition of expensive high quality
observations for generating the calibration data needed by the
next generation of cosmological surveys.}},

 abstract = {{\textbackslash Aims: We propose a new mass mapping algorithm,
specifically designed to recover small-scale information from a
combination of gravitational shear and flexion. Including
flexion allows us to supplement the shear on small scales in
order to increase the sensitivity to substructures and the
overall resolution of the convergence map without relying on
strong lensing constraints. \textbackslash Methods: To preserve
all available small scale information, we avoid any binning of
the irregularly sampled input shear and flexion fields and treat
the mass mapping problem as a general ill-posed inverse problem,
which is regularised using a robust multi-scale wavelet sparsity
prior. The resulting algorithm incorporates redshift, reduced
shear, and reduced flexion measurements for individual galaxies
and is made highly efficient by the use of fast Fourier
estimators. \textbackslash Results: We tested our reconstruction
method on a set of realistic weak lensing simulations
corresponding to typical HST/ACS cluster observations and
demonstrate our ability to recover substructures with the
inclusion of flexion, which are otherwise lost if only shear
information is used. In particular, we can detect substructures
on the 15`` scale well outside of the critical region of the
clusters. In addition, flexion also helps to constrain the shape
of the central regions of the main dark matter halos.

 abbr = {A&A},
 abstract = {{Context. Upcoming spectroscopic galaxy surveys are extremely promising
to help in addressing the major challenges of cosmology, in
particular in understanding the nature of the dark universe. The
strength of these surveys, naturally described in spherical
geometry, comes from their unprecedented depth and width, but an
optimal extraction of their three-dimensional information is of
utmost importance to best constrain the properties of the dark
universe. \textbackslash Aims: Although there is theoretical
motivation and novel tools to explore these surveys using the 3D
spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power spectrum of galaxy number
counts C$_{{\ensuremath{\ell}}}$(k,k'), most survey
optimisations and forecasts are based on the tomographic
spherical harmonics power spectrum
C$^{(ij)\_{\ensuremath{\ell}}}$. The goal of this paper is to
perform a new investigation of the information that can be
extracted from these two analyses in the context of planned
stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys. \textbackslash Methods: We
compared tomographic and 3D SFB techniques by comparing the
forecast cosmological parameter constraints obtained from a
Fisher analysis. The comparison was made possible by careful and
coherent treatment of non-linear scales in the two analyses,
which makes this study the first to compare 3D SFB and
tomographic constraints on an equal footing. Nuisance parameters
related to a scale- and redshift-dependent galaxy bias were also
included in the computation of the 3D SFB and tomographic power
spectra for the first time. \textbackslash Results: Tomographic
and 3D SFB methods can recover similar constraints in the
absence of systematics. This requires choosing an optimal number
of redshift bins for the tomographic analysis, which we computed
to be N = 26 for z$_{med}$ ≃ 0.4, N = 30 for z$_{med}$ ≃ 1.0,
and N = 42 for z$_{med}$ ≃ 1.7. When marginalising over nuisance
parameters related to the galaxy bias, the forecast 3D SFB
constraints are less affected by this source of systematics than
the tomographic constraints. In addition, the rate of increase
of the figure of merit as a function of median redshift is
higher for the 3D SFB method than for the 2D tomographic method.
\textbackslash Conclusions: Constraints from the 3D SFB analysis
are less sensitive to unavoidable systematics stemming from a
redshift- and scale-dependent galaxy bias. Even for surveys that
are optimised with tomography in mind, a 3D SFB analysis is more
powerful. In addition, for survey optimisation, the figure of
merit for the 3D SFB method increases more rapidly with
redshift, especially at higher redshifts, suggesting that the 3D
SFB method should be preferred for designing and analysing
future wide-field spectroscopic surveys. CosmicPy, the Python

 abstract = {{Detection of supernovae (SNe) and, more generally, of transient events
in large surveys can provide numerous false detections. In the
case of a deferred processing of survey images, this implies
reconstructing complete light curves for all detections,
requiring sizable processing time and resources. Optimizing the
detection of transient events is thus an important issue for
both present and future surveys. We present here the
optimization done in the SuperNova Legacy Survey (SNLS) for the
5-year data deferred photometric analysis. In this analysis,
detections are derived from stacks of subtracted images with one
stack per lunation. The 3-year analysis provided 300,000
detections dominated by signals of bright objects that were not
perfectly subtracted. Allowing these artifacts to be detected
leads not only to a waste of resources but also to possible
signal coordinate contamination. We developed a subtracted image
stack treatment to reduce the number of non SN-like events using
morphological component analysis. This technique exploits the
morphological diversity of objects to be detected to extract the
signal of interest. At the level of our subtraction stacks, SN-
like events are rather circular objects while most spurious
detections exhibit different shapes. A two-step procedure was
necessary to have a proper evaluation of the noise in the
subtracted image stacks and thus a reliable signal extraction.
We also set up a new detection strategy to obtain coordinates
with good resolution for the extracted signal. SNIa Monte-Carlo
(MC) generated images were used to study detection efficiency
and coordinate resolution. When tested on SNLS 3-year data this
procedure decreases the number of detections by a factor of two,
while losing only 10\% of SN-like events, almost all faint ones.
MC results show that SNIa detection efficiency is equivalent to
that of the original method for bright events, while the
coordinate resolution is improved.}},

the inversion of gravitational lensing measurements to recover

wavelets and 1D line-of-sight Dirac functions - we show that
clusters of galaxies can be identified and accurately localized

simulated data consistent with the quality currently attainable
in large surveys. We present a thorough statistical analysis of
the errors and biases in both the redshifts of detected

produce reconstructions at significantly higher resolution than

largely unbiased when the redshift is known and whose bias is
constrained to {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}5 per cent in the majority

problem. Considering that the 3D dark matter density is sparse
in an appropriate wavelet based 3D dictionary, we propose an
iterative thresholding algorithm to solve a penalized least-
squares problem. We present our results on simulated dark matter
halos and compare them to state of the art linear reconstruction
techniques. We show that thanks to our 3D sparsity constraint
the quality of the reconstructed maps can be greatly improved.}},

 abstract = {{Context. Future cosmological surveys will provide 3D large scale
structure maps with large sky coverage, for which a 3D spherical
Fourier-Bessel (SFB) analysis in spherical coordinates is
natural. Wavelets are particularly well-suited to the analysis
and denoising of cosmological data, but a spherical 3D isotropic
wavelet transform does not currently exist to analyse spherical
3D data. \textbackslash Aims: The aim of this paper is to
present a new formalism for a spherical 3D isotropic wavelet,
i.e. one based on the SFB decomposition of a 3D field and
accompany the formalism with a public code to perform wavelet
transforms. \textbackslash Methods: We describe a new 3D
isotropic spherical wavelet decomposition based on the
undecimated wavelet transform (UWT) described in Starck et al.
(2006). We also present a new fast discrete spherical Fourier-
Bessel transform (DSFBT) based on both a discrete Bessel
transform and the HEALPIX angular pixelisation scheme. We test
the 3D wavelet transform and as a toy-application, apply a
denoising algorithm in wavelet space to the Virgo large box
cosmological simulations and find we can successfully remove
noise without much loss to the large scale structure.
\textbackslash Results: We have described a new spherical 3D
isotropic wavelet transform, ideally suited to analyse and
denoise future 3D spherical cosmological surveys, which uses a
novel DSFBT. We illustrate its potential use for denoising using
a toy model. All the algorithms presented in this paper are
available for download as a public code called MRS3D at
http://jstarck.free.fr/mrs3d.html}},
